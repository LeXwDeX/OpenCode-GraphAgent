/**
 * #524 Phase 1: default-on residue sweep for crash/in-flight zombies.
 *
 * Session.remove scrubs its session aggregate and every related dag aggregate
 * (terminal workflows included), but a crash between the session-row delete
 * and the scrub — or a project cascade that removes read-model rows without
 * any remove call — leaves durable event aggregates whose SessionTable and
 * WorkflowTable read models are BOTH gone. Read models commit atomically with
 * an aggregate's first event (the projectors run inside the publish
 * transaction), so "events visible, both read models absent" is exactly the
 * zombie shape. Live sessions, archived sessions (they keep their row), and
 * live workflows never match the predicate.
 *
 * Removal is a single atomic guarded DELETE (see `removeResidue`): the
 * both-read-models-absent guard is re-evaluated inside the delete statement
 * itself, so a read model a concurrent replay/publish recreates after
 * candidate selection survives — there is no select-then-remove TOCTOU
 * window. Soft-degrading: a failed residue read or a failed per-aggregate
 * removal is logged and left for a later pass — the sweep never fails the
 * application path. The Durable manifest only contains session- and
 * dag-family events, so every aggregate id in event_sequence is keyed by one
 * of the two checked read models.
