# RuntimeAsset modifications

This module is self-developed for the OpenCode-GraphAgent fork and is licensed
under AGPL-3.0-or-later. Its full license text is in `LICENSE`.

Every TypeScript source file in this directory starts with the two lines from
`SPDX-HEADER.txt`. Code copied or adapted from an upstream MIT file must retain
the upstream copyright and MIT permission notice; it must not be relabeled as
solely AGPL without a provenance review.

Substantial changes are traceable through Git history and release metadata.
Each release source archive records the exact commit and build inputs. When a
change cannot be understood from its commit and path history, add a dated entry
below with the affected paths and a factual summary.
