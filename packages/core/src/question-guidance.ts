export const description = `Use this tool when a decision changes scope, authorization, acceptance criteria, or an irreversible outcome and existing instructions do not resolve it. For an ordinary preference with a reasonable default, choose that default, state the assumption, and continue.

A question blocks until answered or until \`question_timeout\` seconds pass (default 60). After the user starts answering, inactivity times out after \`question_timeout\` seconds and the response phase ends after five minutes. If a question times out, the user may be away from the computer. Choose the best solution yourself based on the task, existing instructions, and available evidence. State assumptions without claiming the user answered. Every question with \`options\` SHOULD put exactly one "(Recommended)" option first as an unanswered fallback. A fallback is a recommendation, not a restriction; choose a better solution when the task, instructions, and evidence support it. Silence never grants new scope or permission for an irreversible action. Defer a dependent step only when it requires missing authorization or a key fact that cannot be reasonably inferred, and continue other authorized work. A dismissed question means the user declined to answer: do not ask it again in the same turn; continue independent authorized work and report the blocked step.

Usage notes:
- When \`custom\` is enabled (default), a "Type your own answer" option is added automatically; don't include "Other" or catch-all options
- Answers are returned as arrays of labels; set \`multiple: true\` to allow selecting more than one
- Even with \`multiple: true\`, timeout lists only one suggested candidate and records no user selections
- If several options carry "(Recommended)", the first marked option is the suggested fallback. If none is marked, the first option is suggested. A free-form question has no suggested candidate; that alone does not block work.
- A candidate is never automatic permission. Do not repeat the same question after timeout or dismissal in the same turn.`
