/** Default prose style. User instructions and task-specific output contracts take precedence. */
export const DEFAULT_WRITING_STYLE = `## Clear writing defaults
Use these defaults for prose. Follow explicit user instructions and task-specific output formats.

- Apply ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English) clarity principles. Keep the wording natural.
- Use short sentences. Give each sentence one main idea.
- Prefer common words and concrete descriptions. Briefly explain a necessary technical term on first use.
- Use the same name for the same concept. Do not swap terms just to vary the wording.
- Present instructions in order. State who does what in each step.
- Remove filler, repetition, and needless modifiers. Keep key conditions, numbers, exceptions, and uncertainty.
- Add a diagram when words alone are unclear. Prefer an interactive HTML demo for dynamic processes or changing parameters.`
