/**
 * Drift guard: the projector's event→status from-guards must stay a subset of
 * the declared iron-law transition tables in core/types.ts.
 *
 * The tables (getValidNextNodeStatuses / getValidNextWorkflowStatuses) are the
 * declared state machine enforced by publisher-side guards; the projector's
 * from-lists are a second encoding used as SQL race protection. Historically
 * the two drifted apart silently (e.g. the projector accepted
 * pending→completed which the table forbids). This test welds them together:
 * any edit to one side without the other fails here.
 *
 * Exemptions:
 * - self-transitions (from === to): idempotent re-application of a replayed
 *   event, not a state change.
 * - WorkflowStatusProjection.replanReopen (completed→running): the single
 *   sanctioned exception to terminal irreversibility — additive extend may
 *   reopen a naturally-completed workflow (see dag.ts reopenCompleted).

// Note: core/dag/core/transitions.ts (transitionToNodeEvent & friends) is a
// third encoding of the same machine with zero production callers — a
// capability reservoir kept for the event-semantics mapping. It is exercised
// by dag-core.test.ts only and intentionally not welded here.
//
// Note (ticket A, method-A): NodeStatusProjection.cancelled.to === "failed"
// is intentional, not a missing target. NodeCancelled has no independent
// terminal status — the NodeStatus enum has no CANCELLED and
// getValidNextNodeStatuses never returns cancelled, so a node row can never
// hold status="cancelled". The drift test passes for cancelled because
// "failed" is a legal target from every cancelled.from state; a phantom
// node-level "cancelled" target is what this alignment rules out. The
// cancellation marker rides on error_reason ("cancelled via replan"), locked
// by dag-node-cancelled-projection.test.ts and the opencode canonical proof
// at packages/opencode/test/dag/dag-escalation-clear-flag.test.ts:130-148.
