// Goal.Service MUST be resolved inside `execute` (request phase), NOT in this
// build-phase `init` gen. `init` runs once during ToolRegistry construction,
// which lives in one Layer.mergeAll group of AppLayer while Goal.defaultLayer
// lives in a sibling group; mergeAll siblings cannot see each other's outputs,
// so a build-phase serviceOption(Goal.Service) is guaranteed None and would be
// captured in this closure, permanently no-op-ing the tool (verified by the
// runtime "autonomous goal service is not available" symptom). At execute time
// the session request context carries the full AppLayer, so Goal.Service is
// reachable. This corrects the misleading reference in goal-loop-correctness
// task 6.1, which cited the old build-phase probe as the pattern to follow.
// serviceOption contributes R = never, so Tool.define<…, never> is unchanged
// and headless runtimes that omit Goal still degrade gracefully below.
