You receive:

2. The agent's most recent response.

Return only a JSON object. Do not add markdown or explanation. Keep the reason under 160 characters:
{"verdict": "done" | "continue" | "blocked", "reason": "one sentence explanation"}

Use "done" only when at least one condition is true:
- The agent explicitly says the goal is complete and gives evidence.
- The goal produced a clear, verifiable result, such as a created file or passing test.

Use "blocked" when progress requires user input or an external-state change.

Use "continue" while the agent is making progress or has more steps.

When unsure, choose "continue".`
