# ADR-0002: Project Memory commits are versioned and process-safe

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-11

## Context

Project Memory is shared by every worktree of one Project. Separate OpenCode processes can therefore read the same Topic revision and attempt conflicting updates. Per-process mutexes and per-file atomic writes do not prevent the last writer from silently replacing another process's confirmed content, nor do they make a multi-Topic update crash-atomic.

## Decision

Memory Store is the commit authority. Its public mutation surface is limited to:

- `commit(projectID, expectedRevision, applied)`, which rejects a stale revision;
- `updateTopics(projectID, update)`, which acquires the existing cross-process `EffectFlock`, reads the latest snapshot inside the lock, applies one synchronous update, and commits it.

Each successful mutation writes a complete Topic generation into a temporary directory, renames that directory into place, and atomically publishes a manifest containing the new revision and generation. Readers follow only the manifest. A crash before manifest publication leaves the previous generation authoritative; a crash after publication leaves the complete new generation authoritative.

Legacy `topics/` data is revision zero and is promoted on the first commit. Previous and orphaned generations remain non-authoritative. Their garbage collection requires the separate Project Memory retention policy.

Project identity migration holds the old Project's process lock while moving or merging its Memory Home. The Project database retires the old identity only after Memory migration succeeds.

## Consequences

- Concurrent worktrees cannot silently lose same-Topic updates when they use the Store mutation API.
- Stale callers receive an explicit revision conflict.
- Restart observes either the complete old generation or the complete new generation, never a partial batch.
- Store writes use more disk space until retention policy defines safe generation cleanup.
- Callers cannot persist an already-computed stale Topic set through an unversioned write API.
